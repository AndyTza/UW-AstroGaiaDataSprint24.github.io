The explicit goal is to create or learn something. These are to be broadly defined. Write new experimental code, try a new method, learn some new data, recreate a plot, make a webpage, write a tutorial, form a new collaboration!

TL;DR see [Advice](#advice)! 

## Advice
Below is a list of 10 items that we believe are good concepts for first-time attendees to Data Sprints:

1. Work on any project you like that is broadly related to Gaia.

2. Talk to your fellow sprinters! Everyone should feel free to join any project today.

3. If you need inspiration or new things to work on, feel free to join other people’s projects or ask for ideas!

4. No private data or results are allowed. Collaboration and open science are inherent in a Sprint’s DNA.

5. Come with ideas or be willing to collaborate with others. Set goals. Make a plot, learn something new, read a paper, understand a concept, help someone, or start a new project.

6. Embrace cross-team collaboration. Engage with participants from diverse groups, attending sessions beyond your immediate focus. Foster a collaborative environment to explore how Gaia intersects with different teams, gaining valuable insights across various domains.

7. It's okay to come with ideas to the workshop. It's also **equally** okay to come to the workshop with no ideas. Our event is meant to foster a collaborative environment. 

8. Invite others to your conversation. If you have a group going and notice someone who is looking to join, welcome them to your conversation.

9. Above all, make sure to have fun and make new friends!


## Personal Anecdote from SOC

I will never forget the morning I headed to the [Flatiron Institute at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) to join a group of astronomers for a hackathon on the newly released Gaia Data Release 2. At the time, I was an undergraduate student with barely any research experience in astronomy, and Gaia was a relatively unknown entity to me. Nevertheless, my advisors suggested I participate in the Gaia DR2 hackathon, believing that such workshops are, at their core, the most enjoyable aspect of scientific work: collaboration.

Despite the early hour (a lively 8 AM in bustling New York), as I entered the room, it felt like stepping into a playground where people were eagerly excited to discuss projects and scientific ideas they had been waiting for years to explore. Shouts and voices of awe were heard across the room as folks were making discoveries in real time. Some, like myself, were there merely for the experience—a journey that I soon realized was a pivotal moment in my career.

During the event, I created a simple scatter plot depicting the positions of stars near the notorious Andromeda Galaxy. It was awe-inspiring to discover that Gaia's sensitivity allowed it to detect stars in a galaxy located 2.5 million light years away from us. While my plot was rudimentary, it marked a significant step in my comfort with thinking and working with Gaia. I personally owe my own excitement about data and telescope from that workshop.

As we approach another major data revolution in Astronomy, with the imminent start of the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory that will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://rubinobservatory.org/), the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/), the recently launched JWST, and the future releases of Gaia DR4 and Gaia Legacy Survey, the excitement is undeniable. 

We hope you find this workshop educational and that it provides an opportunity to meet new people, engage in discussions, and learn collaboratively—ingredients that make our jobs so enjoyable.

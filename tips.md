The explicit goal is to create or learn something. These are to be broadly defined. Write new experimental code, try a new method, learn some new data, recreate a plot, make a webpage, write a tutorial, form a new collaboration!

TL;DR see [Advice](#advice)! 

## Advice
Below is a list of 10 items that we believe are good concepts for first-time attendees to Data Sprints:

1. Work on any project you like that is broadly related to Gaia.

2. Talk to your fellow sprinters! Everyone should feel free to join any project.

3. If you need inspiration or new things to work on, feel free to join other people’s projects or ask for ideas!

4. No private data or results are allowed. Collaboration and open science are inherent in a Sprint’s DNA.

5. Make sure to prioritize open communication amongst your collaborators. Ensure that all participants feel comfortable expressing their ideas and opinions even if they're not expert. In each working group strive to create an atmosphere where everyone's voice is heard and valued.

6. Come with ideas or be willing to collaborate with others. Set goals. Make a plot, learn something new, read a paper, understand a concept, help someone, or start a new project.

7. Embrace cross-team collaboration and engage with other participants.

8. It's okay to come with ideas to the workshop. It's also **equally** okay to come to the workshop with no ideas. Our event is meant to foster a collaborative environment. 

9. Invite others to your conversation. If you have a group going and notice someone who is looking to join, welcome them to your conversation.

10. Above all, make sure to have fun and make new friends!
